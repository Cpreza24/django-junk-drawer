## About the App

**Junk Drawer** is a full-stack CRUD web application that helps users track household items by organizing them into rooms—think of it as a digital version of the chaotic catch-all drawer in every home.

Each user can:

- Sign up and log in
- Create rooms (e.g., Kitchen, Bathroom, Garage)
- Add, edit, and delete items stored in each room

The idea came from our team’s experience constantly losing everyday tools and gadgets around the house. We built this app as part of a General Assembly Django project to explore full-stack development, teamwork, and scalable app design.
